How about an app that calls somebody at random from your address book? It's called "Get talking"

Reality Check: "Get Talking" Random Call App
Okay, this is a HUGE simplification. Let me assess it honestly:

Technical Feasibility: ✅ Very Easy
This is actually trivial from a technical standpoint:

// Literally the core functionality:
1. Read contacts (READ_CONTACTS permission)
2. Filter to contacts with phone numbers
3. Pick random contact
4. Intent to dial/call (CALL_PHONE permission)
Development time: 1-2 weeks for a complete MVP (seriously)

Permissions:

READ_CONTACTS - Easy approval
CALL_PHONE - Easy approval
Both are common, non-sensitive permissions
No costs: No APIs, no backend, no servers needed

The Brutal Honesty
Pros:
✅ Actually achievable - Perfect first Android app
✅ No technical blockers - Everything is straightforward
✅ Easy Play Store approval - Low-risk permissions
✅ Unique concept - I haven't seen this exact app
✅ Could go viral - Simple, shareable idea
✅ Social/mental health angle - Combat isolation, encourage connection

Cons:
❌ Very limited functionality - It's essentially one button
❌ Unclear monetization - Hard to charge for this
❌ Low retention - How often would people use it?
❌ Niche appeal - Who actually wants random calls?
❌ One-trick pony - Not much to build on
❌ Competitive moat - Anyone could clone this in a day

The Core Question: Would People Actually Use This?
Potential users:

People trying to reconnect with old friends
Social anxiety exposure therapy (gradual social contact)
Lonely people wanting to talk
People in "social debt" who feel bad about not calling friends
Fun/novelty seekers
Potential problems:

Calling at bad times (middle of night, work hours)
Calling people you don't want to talk to (ex, estranged family)
Awkwardness when they answer: "Why are you calling?"
Most calls go to voicemail anyway
How to Make This Actually Viable
If you want to pursue this, you'd need to add substance:

Feature Ideas to Make It Real:
v1 (MVP - 2 weeks)

Random contact selector
"Call" button
Basic filters (exclude certain contacts)
Time restrictions (don't call at 3am)
v2 (Make it useful - 1 month)

Smart scheduling: "Call someone this week" reminders
Conversation starters: Suggest topics when they answer
Contact groups: Separate lists (close friends, family, acquaintances)
Streak tracking: Gamify staying in touch
Call notes: Log what you talked about last time
v3 (Make it valuable - 2-3 months)

Relationship manager: Track when you last contacted people
AI suggestions: "You haven't called Mom in 3 weeks"
Integration with calendar: "Call Dad on his birthday"
Statistics: "You called 12 people this month!"
Social goals: "Call 1 friend per week"
Now it's more like a "relationship maintenance tool" rather than just random calling.

Comparable Apps
Similar concept space:

Slowly: Pen pal app for intentional connection
Locket: Random photo sharing with friends
BeReal: Random time to post daily
Snapchat streaks: Gamified staying in touch
Key insight: The random element creates accountability and removes decision paralysis

Monetization (If You Go This Route)
Free tier:

Random call from entire contact list
Basic filters
Premium ($1.99/month or $9.99/year):

Multiple contact groups
Smart scheduling
Conversation starters
Relationship tracking
Analytics
Alternative:

Completely free
Monetize with tasteful ads
Goal: Viral growth over revenue
My Honest Take
As a commercial app: 3/10 - Too simple, hard to monetize, unclear market

As a learning project: 9/10 - Perfect first Android app, achievable, complete

As a viral experiment: 6/10 - Could get media attention, fun concept, might fade quickly

As a foundation for something bigger: 7/10 - Could evolve into relationship management tool

What I'd Actually Recommend
You have three paths:

Path 1: Build This as Your First Learning Project
Take 2 weeks to learn Android by building this
Get it on the Play Store
See if anyone uses it
Use it as a portfolio piece
Then build something more substantial
This is actually smart - you'll learn:

Kotlin/Android basics
Permissions
Contacts API
Intents
Basic UI
Play Store submission
Path 2: Expand It Into Something Real
Build "Get Talking" as a full relationship maintenance app:

Core: Random call feature
Add: Relationship tracking, smart reminders, conversation tools
Market as: "Never lose touch with friends again"
Monetize: Premium features
This could actually work - addresses real problem (social isolation, maintaining friendships)

Path 3: Combine Ideas
What if we merge concepts from your previous ideas?

"Personal Connection Assistant"

AI-powered relationship manager
Random call prompts (your idea)
Conversation starter suggestions (LLM)
Spam text filtering (your pivot idea)
Calendar integration (original idea)
Voice/personality customization (original idea)
Now it's a complete personal communication assistant focused on meaningful connection.

The Decision Point
Questions for you:

Goal: Are you trying to learn Android, or build a business?

Timeline: Do you want to ship something in 2 weeks or 3 months?

Scope: Simple app to get your feet wet, or substantial product?
